The experiment is designed to understand the concept of distance and connectivity in digital images. This experiment consists of three experiments:

1. Compute distance between two points in an image

2. Obtain iso-distance points from a given point

3. Covert binary image into gray-scale image by taking distance transform with respect to a given point

These experiments can be performed under three basic distance metrics settings accessible using ¡°select type of distance¡± and two basic connectivity types accessible using ¡°connectivity¡± tab.

**Steps to run**

Experiment-1:

1. Select two points on the image grid by doing mouse click on red and green squares which highlight your select location.

2. Select distance metric from using ¡°select type of distance¡± option

3. Select ¡°run¡± option to see the distance between two selected points w.r.t to the given distance metrics

4. Select different distance and connectivity type to observe change in the computed distance.

Experiment-2:

1. Select a point on the image grid

2. Select distance value using distance scroll bar appeared next to it.

3. Select ¡°run¡± option to see iso-distance points w.r.t to the input point

4. Select different distance and connectivity type to observe change in result.

Experiment-3:

1. Left image panel shows a binary image and small red point on it.

2. Move location of red point by clicking at the respective location

3. Select distance metric from using ¡°select type of distance¡± option

4. Select ¡°run¡± option to conversion of binary image to gray scale image based on the distance transform computed w.r.t to the input location

5. Select different distance and connectivity type to observe variation in the gray scale output.
