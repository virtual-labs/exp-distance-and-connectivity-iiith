In most image processing tasks, basic operations typically involve modification of a pixel¡¯s value based on the value of its neighours. A digital image is defined on a discrete grid of points. Hence there are different ways in which one can define the spatial relation between pixels. For instance we could consider two pixels as ¡®neighbours¡¯ only if they share one side/ edge. Alternately, two pixels could be neighbours if they share a vertex. These two lead to different definitions of neighbourhood for a pixel. The extent of a neighbourhood is also of interest as it is useful in finding not only which pixels belong to an object in an image but also the extent of the object.

The notions of connectivity and distance between two pixels are useful in defining the neighborhood for a pixel. Connectivity tells us which pixels are `next¡¯ to which. It helps answer questions like ¡°Can we reach pixel p0 from pixel p1?¡± The concept of connectivity also helps simplify the definition of region or boundary in an image. Once we know we can reach p1 from p0, the cost to reach or distance is of interest. There are different distance metrics and we will study them in this experiment.
